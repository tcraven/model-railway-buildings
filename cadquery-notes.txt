CadQuery Notes

It was tricky to install the library because there is no Apple Silicon version.

Here is how to install it:
https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery/issues/891#issuecomment-1330922010
```
$ arch -x86_64 brew install miniconda
$ arch -x86_64 conda install -c cadquery -c conda-forge cadquery=master
$ arch -x86_64 conda install -c cadquery -c conda-forge cq-editor=master
$ arch -x86_64 /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/bin/python
```

Use the special Python version for running cadquery scripts:
./cq-python

Run the CadQuery Editor user interface:
./cq-editor

There is no Pipenv for this directory - everything is contained inside the Conda Python installation.
